## Baseball Savant Video Downloader

This downloads the last pitch of every at bat for a given player in the given date range. The videos will get concatenated into one "out.mp4".
### Requirements
This requires ruby and youtube-dl to be installed. As of now, it requires linux because the downloader uses a bash script. 

### How To Use
To run, do:
```
  $ ruby fetch.rb <startDate> <endDate> <playerID> <justLastPitch?>
```
where startDate and endDate is the range of videos you are looking for in the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY (2019-05-11)
Player ID is the 6-digit identifier for a player. It can be found in the csv on [this](http://crunchtimebaseball.com/baseball_map.html) website. justLastPitch is an optional (defaults to true) parameter that can be used to fetch all the pitches in every at bat if false
An example command to find the at bats of Mike Trout between 5/5 and 5/11:
```
  $ ruby fetch.rb 2019-05-05 2019-05-11 545361
```
